# LabourOnDemand

    The problem of unemployment among labourers is looming large. They are unable to contact people with the 
    right jobs for their skill set.Hence, they resort to searching for a job through contractors. Most contractors
    exploit the situation by paying the labourers a lesser fee than they deserve. They make huge profits though 
    they don’t toil nearly as hard as the labourers.
    
    Our app aims at providing a solution to this problem. We aim to establish a direct contact between the labourers 
    and the “customers” (customers who need service). The app focuses on cutting down the middle man, i.e. contractor,
    making unethical profits from the current existing situation of the labourers. Through our app, the labourers
    directly receive their payment from the customer . Hence they get a fruitful result for their hard work on the
    field. This also reduces unemployment of skilled labourers which is a need of the hour.
    
    The app provides instant service to the customers by allocating a labourer on demand based on the requirements 
    of the customer s. It provides separate logins for recruiters and labourers. The labourers are provided with a
    page to enter their skill set on their first login. The service provided to the customer  is through location
    based service after choosing the category of service and the detail explanation of the current job needed.
